          <span class="pb-2 italic font-semibold">America Beans Properties/ Details</span> <br>
          Coffee America: <br>
          High-quality Arabica coffee from the Americas offers a delightful combination of slightly sweet taste, floral notes, and fruity aromas. The fruity acidity and absence of bitterness are often perceived as pleasant by coffee enthusiasts, with the intensity of these characteristics influenced by the degree of roasting. Lighter roasts emphasize the fruity characteristics, while darker roasts offer a richer flavor profile with caramelized sweetness. <br> <br>
          Origin and Cultivation: <br>
          Coffee beans from the Americas are typically cultivated at moderate to high altitudes, ranging from 900-1,200 meters above sea level. The plants thrive in the region's delicate climate, which provides the ideal conditions for slow maturation and optimal flavor development. The cultivation process demands careful attention, with longer periods for pruning and fertilizing to ensure optimal growth and development. The largest producers of Arabica coffee in the Americas include Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Honduras

          <span class="pb-2">Varieties of Beans: </span> <br> <br>
          
          <span class="font-semibold" >1.	Brazilian Bourbon: </span> Renowned for its smooth and creamy texture, Brazilian Bourbon beans offer nutty and chocolatey undertones, with a medium body and mild acidity. <br>
          
          <span class="font-semibold">2.	Colombian Excelso</span> Grown in high-altitude regions, Colombian Excelso beans feature a well-balanced flavor profile with medium body, bright acidity, and versatile flavor notes, making them ideal for various brewing methods. <br>
          <span class="font-semibold">3.	Costa Rican Tarrazu</span> Tarrazu beans from Costa Rica are celebrated for their bright acidity, full body, and complex flavor profile, with notes of citrus, honey, and caramel. <br>
          <span class="font-semibold">4.	Guatemalan Huehuetenango:</span> Hailing from the Huehuetenango region, Guatemalan beans offer a complex flavor profile with notes of chocolate, spice, and fruit, making them highly sought after by coffee aficionados. <br>
          <span class="font-semibold">5.	Mexican Chiapas:</span> Chiapas beans from Mexico are known for their smooth and mellow flavor profile, with medium acidity, chocolatey sweetness, and hints of nuttiness, making them perfect for espresso and French press brewing. <br> <br>
          The low acidity of Brazilian Bourbon Santos derives from the region's lower growing elevations. This is low relative to areas such as Central America where higher elevation plantations (e.g., 1,200 meters above sea level) produce premium gourmet coffees that are brighter (higher acidity).
