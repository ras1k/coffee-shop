            What happens to the rewards point I collected before the policy was
            revised?
          </p>
          <p>
            The points you collected before the revision remain as they were,
            you will now need to collect some more points to reach the new
            requirement for redemption.
          </p>
          <p class="font-bold py-6">
            I had some credit balance on my card what about that?
          </p>
          <p>
            Any unused credit balance available on your rewards card can be used
            anytime you want. It will stay as it is till you decide to
            redeem/use towards your India Bazaar purchase.

          <p class="font-bold py-6">
            Will the loyalty program resume back to the earlier terms?
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, this is a temporary change and we will be trying our best to
            resume our rewards policy back to the earlier terms or make it even
            better.
          </p>
          <p class="font-bold py-6">Why do I need a rewards card anyway?</p>
          <p>
            Rewards card not only enables you to get the $20 worth of free
            groceries as a reward but also eases the process of returns/exchange
            if needed. You don’t need to worry about carrying the invoice every
            time you have an issue with a product. You can simply give our
            customer services the phone number associated with your rewards card
            and our team can pull out the details on their end.
          </p>
          <p class="font-bold py-6">
            Do I need to always carry my rewards card in order to add and redeem
            points from it?
          </p>
          <p>
            No, you don’t. Our cashiers can pull up your rewards account with
            the phone number on it too. So, you can just give them the ph# on
            your account and they can take care of the rest for you.
          </p>
          <p class="font-bold py-6">
            Why did you revise the terms for the loyalty program?
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest reason for this change is the worldwide economic
            distress and sudden changes caused due to Covid-19. As we all are
            trying our best to cope up with the ongoing pandemic, there are
            certain effects and aspects that are out of one’s control.

          <p class="py-6">
            Some of the reasons for revising the loyalty program are:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc ps-4">
            <li class="mb-2">
              High shortage of labor due to the ongoing pandemic.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              Increased labor cost and demand generated due to our alternate
              grocery delivery and curbside pickup channels.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              Procurement of products has become challenging and is available at
              an increased cost
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">Increased maintenance and disinfecting cost.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              The import and export of goods have been impacted and disturbed at
              the global level. Resulting in a disturbed supply chain and price
              inflation.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              Limiting the number of customers in stores at a time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="py-6">
            All these are important aspects of our business that can result in
            price inflation of our products. As we always stand by our motto of
            offering our shoppers the best quality products at the lowest price
            possible, increasing the price of our products will never be an
            option for us and that is why we have revised our loyalty program.
            For our shoppers’ convenience we are also working on improving our
            grocery delivery and curbside pickup channels, and revising the
            loyalty program will help us in achieving these faster.
